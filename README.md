# akitchensyncio
Utility functions for asyncio which Stephan wished where in the stdlib but aren't.

## `wrap_future(f)`

Takes a callable `f` which returns an awaitable,
and returns a callable which wraps the awaitable in
`asyncio.ensure_future`.

Can also be used as a decorator, especially
with coroutine functions:

```
    @wrap_future
    async def foo(arg1, arg2):
        ...
```

## `transform_future(f, awaitable)`

Apply a function to the result of an awaitable,
return a future which delivers the result.

## `iawait(awaitable)`

"Interactive await" -- Run default eventloop until awaitable has completed.
Mainly useful for interactive experimentation.
